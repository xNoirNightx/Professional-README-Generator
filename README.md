# ReadMe-Generator
Professional README Generator for week 9 challenge

## Description

I was tasked with my ninth challenge to make a README Generator.

- I was able to problem solve and fix code.
- I learned how to use NPMs 
- I learned how to work better in terminal ( work in progress )
- I learned how to work with node
- I learned the importance of README files 

**Note**: A README file enhances the usability, accessibility, and collaboration of a project. It serves as the main source of information, allowing users and developers to quickly understand and engage with the project.

I followed the criteria below provided by the class instructors.

## User Story

- AS A developer
- I WANT a README generator
- SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project


## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
- THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections 
-  entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
- WHEN I enter my project title
- THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
- WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
- THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
- WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
- THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
- WHEN I enter my GitHub username
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
- WHEN I enter my email address
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
- WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
- THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

 **Note**: Im not a fan of back end hahah.
